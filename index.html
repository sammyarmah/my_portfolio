              <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
              <p>A data analyst with expertise in transforming raw data into actionable insights.
                    Proficient in SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and
                    visualization. Skilled in Power Query, Pivot Tables, and dashboard creation to track
                    key metrics and improve decision-making. Experienced in building automated
                    reports, identifying trends, and optimizing business processes through data-driven
                    insights. Passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems and enhance
                    operational performance. Beyond my technical expertise, I believe in the values of
                    humility, respect, and perseverance. I am always eager to challenge myself with
                    difficult tasks, as I believe that growth comes from stepping outside my comfort
                    zone. I am also passionate about traveling, as it broadens my perspective, exposes
                    me to new cultures, and helps me stay adaptable in an ever-evolving world.
                    Furthermore, I am driven by a desire to continuously learn and stay updated with
                    industry trends to leverage new tools and technologies for impactful data-driven
                    decision-making.
